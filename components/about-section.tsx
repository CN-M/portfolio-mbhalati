            I am an aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in
            mathematics and statistics, driven by curiosity and a passion for
            solving challenging problems. My expertise spans full-stack
            development, data analysis, and machine learning, with a focus on
            building impactful, scalable solutions.

                My journey into tech started with a deep interest in mathematics
                and problem-solving, which led me to pursue a degree in
                Mathematical Science, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics.
                This academic foundation has shaped my analytical approach to
                building efficient and scalable solutions.

                When Iâ€™m not writing code, I enjoy designing intuitive user
                interfaces, exploring new technologies, and contributing to
                meaningful community initiatives. I believe in leveraging
                technology to create solutions that address real-world
                challenges, focusing on impact and innovation in every project I
                tackle.
